# How to solve hard (technical) problems

### Mindset

* Every error is an opportunity to learn
* The harder the bugs you solve the better you will be
* Remember that the bug is happening for a logical reason
* Be unreasonably confident in your ability to fix the bug
* There are no hard problems. There is just lack of information about how the system works
