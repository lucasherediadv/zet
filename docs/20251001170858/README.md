# Podman vs. Docker

Choose Podman if you:

* Emphasize security: Podman architecture is inherently more secure than Docker's.
* Plan to move Kubernetes down the road: Podman introduces the pod concept, which makes it a good starting point for Kubernetes.
* Use systemd: One of the main benefits of Podman compared to Docker is that Podman fully integrates with systemd by default. This feature enables Podman to run systemd within the container out of the box.
